# Derivation Validation Tests

Nine tests that verify the derivation engine produces coherent, functional systems. Run these after any changes to init.md, interaction-constraints.md, or tradition-presets.md.

---

## Test 1: Self-Derivation (Research Vault)

**Question:** Does deriving a "Research & Academic" system produce configuration that matches our actual vault?

**Input:**
- Use case: Research & Academic
- Platform: Claude Code
- Focus: Tools for thought for agents

**Derived configuration (from use-case preset):**

| Dimension | Derived Value | Actual Vault Value | Match? |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|--------|
| Granularity | atomic | atomic (one claim per note, prose-as-title) | YES |
| Organization | flat | flat (everything in 01_thinking/, no subfolders) | YES |
| Linking | explicit+implicit | explicit (wiki links) + implicit (qmd semantic search) | YES |
| Processing | heavy | heavy (6 Rs: Record, Reduce, Recite, Reflect, Review, Rethink) | YES |
| Nav depth | 3-tier | 3-tier (index → domain MOCs → topic MOCs → notes) evolving toward 4-tier (sub-MOCs like processing-workflow-throughput.md) | YES (with evolution) |
| Maintenance | condition-based (tight) | continuous during processing + condition-triggered reweave | YES |
| Schema | moderate | moderate (description + topics required; methodology, adapted_from, classification optional) | YES |
| Automation | convention | convention trending to automation (hooks exist for validation, auto-commit, session start; skills encode methodology; but instructions remain primary) | YES (with evolution) |

**Result: 8/8 match.** The derived configuration is a near-perfect prediction of what the vault evolved to organically. Two dimensions show evolution beyond the starting preset (nav depth approaching 4-tier, automation trending from convention toward full), which aligns with the seed-evolve-reseed lifecycle claim.

**Features correctly enabled:**
- Kernel (all 15 primitives): YES — vault has all 15 (self space disabled by default for research, but primitive still passes as CONFIGURABLE)
- inbox-processing: YES (processing = heavy ≥ moderate) — vault has 00_inbox/
- processing-pipeline: YES (processing = heavy) — vault has /ralph, /pipeline, full 6R pipeline
- semantic-search: YES (linking = explicit+implicit) — vault has qmd with 4 collections
- hooks-blueprint: YES (automation ≥ convention) — vault has .claude/hooks/ with 10+ hooks
- validation-hooks: PARTIAL — vault has PostToolUse validation hooks (automation trending beyond convention)

**Gaps between derived and actual:**
1. Vault has **dual operators** (jaime/jaime) — init generates for single operator. This is a multi-agent extension, not a base derivation concern.
2. Vault has **04_meta/logs/** (observations, tensions) — a maturity feature that emerged through practice. Could become a feature for processing ≥ heavy.
3. Vault has **03_twitter/** — domain-specific content pipeline not represented in generic research preset. Would be a second domain in composition test.
4. Vault evolved **numbered folder prefixes** (00_, 01_, 02_, 03_, 04_) — Obsidian ordering convention. Init uses generic names (notes/, inbox/, archive/). Both are valid.

**Conclusion:** The derivation engine correctly predicts the vault's configuration from the "Research" use case. Gaps are evolutionary features consistent with the seed-evolve-reseed lifecycle — they emerged from friction-driven adaptation, not from missing initial configuration.

## Test 2: Cross-Domain (Therapy & Reflection)

**Question:** Does deriving a therapy system produce a coherent configuration with domain-native vocabulary?

**Input:**
- Use case: Therapy & Reflection
- Platform: Claude Code
- Focus: Pattern detection, emotional processing, growth tracking

**Derived configuration:**

| Dimension | Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Granularity | moderate | Reflections are naturally compound — a trigger, reaction, and insight form one thought |
| Organization | flat | Same benefit as research: reflections aren't categories, they're connected experiences |
| Linking | explicit | Direct connections between reflections (no semantic search initially — volume is low) |
| Processing | moderate | Pattern detection across reflections requires some processing, but not full extraction pipeline |
| Nav depth | 2-tier | Hub → topic MOCs (moods, triggers, patterns, growth areas). Volume stays moderate. |
| Maintenance | condition-based (tight) | Review triggered after each session capture. Therapy's value comes from revisiting, not accumulating. |
| Schema | moderate | Mood, trigger, and pattern fields make reflections queryable. Not dense — just enough for retrieval. |
| Automation | convention | Start with instructions. Add hooks when specific friction emerges. |

**Interaction constraint check:**
- Moderate granularity + moderate processing: coherent (processing matches granularity demand)
- Moderate schema + convention automation: coherent (manageable without automated validation)
- Explicit linking + no semantic search: coherent at low volume (<100 notes). WARN: add semantic search if collection grows.
- 2-tier navigation + flat: coherent at moderate volume

**Vocabulary mapping:**

| Research Term | Therapy Term |
|---------------|-------------|
| claim | reflection |
| extract | surface |
| reduce | process |
| inbox | captures |
| thinking notes | reflections |
| MOC | theme |
| description field | summary |
| topics footer | themes |
| relevant notes | connections |
| processing pipeline | reflection cycle |

**Generated template (reflection note):**

```yaml
_schema:
  entity_type: "reflection"
  applies_to: "reflections/*.md"
  required:
    - description
    - themes
  optional:
    - mood
    - trigger
    - pattern
    - growth_area
  enums:
    mood:
      - calm
      - anxious
      - sad
      - hopeful
      - angry
      - grateful
      - overwhelmed
      - curious
```

**Self/ adaptation:**
- `identity.md`: "I am a reflection partner helping you notice patterns in your emotional life..."
- `methodology.md`: "I surface connections between reflections, track recurring patterns, and help you see growth over time..."
- `goals.md`: Active growth threads, not research questions

**Kernel validation prediction:** 15/15 PASS (or 14 PASS + 1 WARN on semantic search if not configured)

**Coherence assessment:** The configuration is internally consistent. Moderate granularity permits moderate processing without the atomic note's heavy processing demand. Tight condition-based maintenance enables pattern detection — the core therapy value. Schema fields use emotional vocabulary (mood, trigger, pattern), not research jargon. The system would feel natural to use for its purpose.

## Test 3: Novel Domain (Competitive Gaming Strategy)

**Question:** Can the derivation engine handle a domain with no direct reference model?

**Input:**
- Use case: Custom — Competitive gaming strategy (e.g., fighting games, card games)
- Platform: Claude Code
- Focus: Matchup knowledge, meta analysis, improvement tracking

**Knowledge type classification:**
- Primary: tactical/strategic knowledge (closest to Research but with strong temporal dynamics)
- Secondary: skill development (closest to Learning)
- Temporal: high (meta shifts frequently, matchup data has shelf life)

**Reference domain mapping:** Research (for strategic analysis) + Learning (for skill tracking) → start from Research preset, adjust for temporal dynamics.

**Derived configuration:**

| Dimension | Value | Rationale (deviation from Research preset) |
|-----------|-------|-------------------------------------------|
| Granularity | moderate | Strategies are naturally compound — a matchup involves character, stage, openings, and punishes as one thought. Not atomic. |
| Organization | flat | Same as research — strategies cross categories (a technique applies across matchups) |
| Linking | explicit+implicit | Cross-matchup connections need semantic search (vocabulary varies: "frame trap" in one game = "mixup" in another) |
| Processing | moderate | Analysis matters but not full extraction pipeline. Process after matches, not during. |
| Nav depth | 3-tier | Hub → game/format → matchup/archetype → specific strategies. Gaming domains have natural sub-structure. |
| Maintenance | condition-based (tight) | Meta shifts require responsive maintenance. Lax thresholds are too slow for competitive contexts. |
| Schema | moderate | Character, matchup, meta_state, confidence fields. Dense enough for querying, not overwhelming. |
| Automation | convention | Start with instructions. Automate match logging when friction emerges. |

**Interaction constraint check:**
- Moderate granularity + moderate processing: coherent
- 3-tier navigation + moderate volume: coherent (gaming domains generate lots of matchup-specific notes)
- Tight condition thresholds + temporal dynamics: coherent (meta shifts frequently in competitive games, tight thresholds catch staleness quickly)
- Explicit+implicit linking + semantic search required: need to configure qmd or equivalent. WARN if not set up.

**Vocabulary mapping:**

| Research Term | Gaming Term |
|---------------|------------|
| claim | strategy note |
| MOC | matchup guide |
| extract | analyze |
| reduce | break down |
| reflect | review (post-match) |
| description | game plan summary |
| topics | matchups, archetypes |
| relevant notes | related strategies |

**Novel schema fields:**

```yaml
_schema:
  entity_type: "strategy-note"
  required:
    - description
    - matchups
  optional:
    - character
    - meta_state
    - confidence
    - counter_to
    - countered_by
    - tested
  enums:
    meta_state:
      - current
      - outdated
      - speculative
    confidence:
      - proven
      - likely
      - experimental
```

**Key derivation insight:** The `meta_state` field addresses temporal dynamics that the Research preset doesn't capture. The "outdated" value enables filtering stale strategies — critical for competitive gaming where last patch's knowledge can be wrong. This field emerged from the interaction between temporal dynamics and schema density.

**Kernel validation prediction:** 15/15 PASS (assuming semantic search is configured)

**Coherence assessment:** The derived configuration makes gaming-domain sense. Moderate granularity captures strategies as compound thoughts without forcing artificial decomposition ("jab into frame trap when opponent respects plus frames" is one idea, not three). Tight condition-based maintenance responds to patch cycles and meta shifts. The `meta_state` field solves the temporal problem naturally. The system would be immediately useful for tracking matchup knowledge.

## Test 4: Multi-Domain Composition (Research + Relationships)

**Question:** Can two domains with different structural densities share a graph?

**Input:**
- Domain A: Research & Academic (atomic, heavy processing, dense links)
- Domain B: People & Relationships (moderate, light processing, sparse links)
- Platform: Claude Code

**Per-domain configurations:**

| Dimension | Research | Relationships | Shared? |
|-----------|----------|---------------|---------|
| Granularity | atomic | moderate | separate |
| Organization | flat | flat | SHARED (same flat principle) |
| Linking | explicit+implicit | explicit | separate densities |
| Processing | heavy | light | separate pipelines |
| Nav depth | 3-tier | 2-tier | separate hierarchies |
| Maintenance | condition-based (tight) | condition-based (lax) | separate thresholds |
| Schema | moderate | moderate | separate templates, shared base fields |
| Automation | convention | convention | SHARED |

**Composition mechanism:**
- Separate templates: `thinking-note.md` (research claims) and `person-note.md` (relationship observations)
- Shared graph: wiki links cross domains (`[[research claim]]` from a person note, `[[person name]]` from a research note)
- Shared hub MOC: `index.md` links to both research domain MOCs and relationship MOCs
- Separate processing: research notes go through full pipeline; relationship notes get light processing (capture + connect)

**Cross-domain linking examples:**
- A person MOC for a collaborator links to research claims they influenced
- A research claim about "agent memory" links to a person who works on that topic
- Shared vocabulary: "insight" works in both domains

**Interaction constraint check:**
- Two different processing intensities in one graph: coherent IF separated by template. Pipeline knows to apply heavy processing to `thinking-note` type and light processing to `person-note` type.
- Two different maintenance threshold sensitivities: coherent IF MOCs track separately. Research MOCs get tight thresholds; relationship MOCs get lax thresholds.
- Cross-domain links: density difference is manageable. A person note with 2 links to research notes is fine. A research note with 1 link to a person note is fine. The concern is MOC maintenance — a person appearing in 10 research MOCs creates update burden. Compensating mechanism: backlinks script reveals cross-domain connections without manual tracking.

**This is exactly what our vault does.** The vault already composes Research (01_thinking/) with People (03_twitter/people/). Research claims link to people who inspired them. People MOCs link to research topics they engage with. The composition works because:
1. Templates differ (thinking-note vs person-moc)
2. Processing differs (full pipeline vs light capture)
3. The shared graph (wiki links) handles cross-domain naturally
4. Hub MOC (index.md) provides unified entry point

**Kernel validation prediction:** 15/15 PASS

**Coherence assessment:** Multi-domain composition works when the shared layer (wiki links, MOC hierarchy, description fields) is domain-agnostic while templates and processing are domain-specific. The five composition rules (from the composable-knowledge-architecture blueprint) hold:
1. Shared graph: wiki links are domain-agnostic ✓
2. Separate templates: each domain has its own schema ✓
3. Separate processing: pipeline routes by note type ✓
4. Shared navigation: hub MOC links to all domains ✓
5. Cross-domain links: natural, not forced ✓

## Test 5: Minimal Platform (Convention-Only)

**Question:** Can all 15 kernel primitives be satisfied on a platform with no hooks, no skills, and no subagent support — using only a context file and filesystem access?

**Input:**
- Use case: Personal journal — regular reflections, goal tracking, occasional pattern review
- Platform: Generic LLM chat with file access (convention-only — no hooks, no skills, no subagents)
- Focus: Low-ceremony capture with condition-triggered synthesis

**Derived configuration:**

| Dimension | Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Granularity | compound | Journal entries are naturally multi-faceted — a day has multiple reflections |
| Organization | flat | Few enough notes that flat works without friction |
| Linking | explicit | Wiki links only — no semantic search infrastructure available |
| Processing | light | Manual review, no pipeline automation |
| Nav depth | 2-tier | Hub → topic areas. Low volume needs minimal hierarchy |
| Maintenance | condition-based (lax) | Light processing generates few maintenance targets — lax thresholds match low volume |
| Schema | minimal | `description` and `topics` only — no automated validation to catch richer fields |
| Automation | convention | Everything lives in context file instructions — the only tool available |

**Kernel primitive mapping at convention-only (minimal) implementations:**

| # | Primitive | Convention-Only Implementation | Satisfied? |
|---|-----------|----------------------|------------|
| 1 | Markdown + YAML | Context file instructs agent to use YAML frontmatter on every note | YES |
| 2 | Wiki links | Context file instructs `[[note title]]` linking with unique filenames | YES |
| 3 | MOC hierarchy | Context file instructs creation of hub MOC and topic MOCs, linking notes to MOCs | YES |
| 4 | Tree injection | Context file instructs agent to `ls` at session start for orientation | YES |
| 5 | Description field | Context file instructs `description:` field in YAML that adds context beyond title | YES |
| 6 | Topics footer | Context file instructs `topics:` field with at least one MOC wiki link per note | YES |
| 7 | Schema enforcement | Context file instructs manual checking of required fields during note creation | YES |
| 8 | Semantic search | Context file instructs periodic manual review guided by topic adjacency and MOC scanning | YES (degraded) |
| 9 | Self space | Context file instructs self/ directory with identity.md, methodology.md, goals.md (CONFIGURABLE — when disabled, goals route to ops/goals.md, methodology to ops/methodology/) | YES |
| 10 | Session rhythm | Context file documents orient/work/persist cycle — agent reads self/ at start, updates at end | YES |
| 11 | Discovery-first | Context file includes "Before creating any note, ask: how will a future session find this?" section | YES |
| 12 | Operational learning loop | Context file instructs agent to note friction in ops/observations/, note contradictions in ops/tensions/, and review when 10+ observations accumulate | YES |
| 13 | Task stack | Context file instructs agent to check ops/tasks/ for prioritized work items before starting | YES |
| 14 | Methodology folder | Context file instructs agent to maintain ops/methodology/ with linked notes about vault self-knowledge | YES |
| 15 | Session capture | Context file instructs agent to save session transcript to ops/sessions/ before ending | YES (degraded — manual save without stop hook) |

**Result: 15/15 PASS.** Every kernel primitive has a viable convention-only implementation. The key is that conventions ARE implementations — instructions in a context file are a legitimate enforcement mechanism, not a placeholder for "real" automation.

**What degrades at convention-only:**
- Schema enforcement relies on instruction-following, which degrades as context fills — no deterministic fallback catches errors
- Semantic search reduces to manual adjacency review — misses cross-vocabulary connections
- Operational learning loop has no threshold automation — the agent must count pending observations manually
- Tree injection via `ls` loads less structured output than a hook-injected tree

**What does NOT degrade:**
- Prose-sentence titles work identically regardless of platform
- Wiki links resolve by filename regardless of automation
- MOC hierarchy functions the same — it is a structural convention, not an automation feature
- Self/ space is just files — reading them at session start requires no hooks
- Session rhythm is behavioral — orient/work/persist is a pattern the agent follows, not infrastructure

**Kernel validation prediction:** 15/15

**Coherence assessment:** The convention-only personal journal demonstrates that the kernel's power comes from structural conventions, not from automation. A context file that says "always add a description field" is not as reliable as a PostToolUse hook that validates it — but it IS a legitimate implementation. The kernel primitives were designed to require only filesystem access and text files. This test confirms that design holds: every primitive can be satisfied through convention when no automation is available. The system will be less robust (no deterministic validation, no automated condition checking), but it will be structurally complete. Full automation is the default — but convention-only systems remain valid for platforms that lack hook support.

## Test 6: Interaction Constraint Violation Recovery

**Question:** When given an intentionally incoherent configuration, does the constraint system detect violations and guide toward a valid configuration?

**Input:**
- Granularity: coarse (long, multi-topic documents)
- Schema: dense (many required fields, rich enums, strict validation)
- Navigation: 4-tier (hub → domain → topic → sub-topic → notes)
- Processing: light (minimal processing, no pipeline)
- Automation: manual (convention only, no hooks or skills)
- Organization: flat
- Linking: explicit only
- Maintenance: condition-based (very lax)

**Constraint violations detected:**

| # | Violated Rule | Type | Explanation |
|---|--------------|------|-------------|
| 1 | `coarse + processing == "heavy"` (inverse: coarse + light is coherent, but coarse + dense schema without processing to populate fields is not) | WARN | Dense schema on coarse notes creates fields that never get filled — who populates 8 required fields on a multi-page document without a processing pipeline? |
| 2 | `schema == "dense" + automation == "convention"` | WARN | Dense schemas without automated validation create unsustainable maintenance burden — the agent must manually check every field on every save |
| 3 | `coarse + navigation == "4-tier"` | WARN | Coarse granularity produces few notes (large documents = fewer files). 4-tier navigation for <50 notes is over-engineering — three layers of MOCs pointing to 30 documents |
| 4 | `processing == "light" + maintenance thresholds very lax` | WARN (compounding) | Light processing generates few connections, and very lax maintenance thresholds mean those few connections are rarely reviewed — the system stagnates |

**Constraint system response:**

The constraint system is productive, not just prohibitive. For each violation, it recommends a specific correction AND explains why:

| Violation | Recommendation | Rationale |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| Dense schema + no automation | Reduce schema to moderate OR add validation scripts | Dense schema without validation means required fields will be missing on 30%+ of notes within 2 months |
| Dense schema + coarse granularity | Reduce schema to moderate — coarse notes are self-contained, dense metadata adds overhead without proportional query value | The fields exist but nobody queries them because the note body already contains everything |
| 4-tier navigation + coarse granularity | Reduce to 2-tier — hub → topic areas. Coarse granularity means fewer notes, fewer notes means simpler navigation suffices | A 4-tier hierarchy for 40 documents means each MOC has 3-5 links — not enough to justify the navigation overhead |
| Light processing + lax maintenance conditions | Tighten condition thresholds OR increase processing to moderate — one must compensate for the other | Without either regular processing or active maintenance conditions, the system becomes a graveyard of disconnected documents |

**Corrected configuration after applying recommendations:**

| Dimension | Original | Corrected | Change Reason |
|-----------|----------|-----------|---------------|
| Granularity | coarse | coarse | No change — valid as starting point |
| Schema | dense | moderate | Reduced to match automation and granularity |
| Navigation | 4-tier | 2-tier | Reduced to match expected note volume |
| Processing | light | light | No change — user preference respected |
| Automation | manual | convention | No change — user preference respected |
| Maintenance | condition-based (very lax) | condition-based (lax) | Thresholds tightened to compensate for light processing |
| Organization | flat | flat | No change — coherent with coarse granularity |
| Linking | explicit | explicit | No change — coherent with low volume |

**Post-correction constraint check:** Zero violations. The corrected configuration is internally consistent.

**Kernel validation prediction:** 15/15 (corrected configuration satisfies all primitives)

**Coherence assessment:** The constraint system serves as a design advisor, not a gatekeeper. It detected four issues in the input configuration, explained why each was problematic, recommended specific corrections, and produced a valid configuration. The key insight is that the constraint system is productive — it does not simply reject bad configurations but guides users toward coherent ones. This is essential for the conversational derivation flow, where users may express preferences that are individually reasonable but collectively incoherent. The system respects user preferences when possible (coarse granularity, light processing, and convention automation all survived) while adjusting dimensions that were in tension with the rest (dense schema downgraded, 4-tier navigation reduced, very lax maintenance thresholds tightened). The corrections are minimal — changing only what is necessary to achieve coherence.

## Test 7: Vocabulary Transformation Fidelity

**Question:** When generating a complete context file for a non-research domain, does ANY research-specific vocabulary leak through?

**Input:**
- Use case: Therapy & Reflection (from Test 2 configuration)
- Platform: Claude Code
- Generate: full context file, templates, skill instructions, self/ files

**Search methodology:**

Scan the entire generated output for research-domain terms that should have been transformed. The search is exhaustive — every term in the universal-to-domain mapping table must be checked.

**Terms to search for (must be ABSENT in therapy output):**

| Research Term | Expected Therapy Equivalent | Context-Dependent Exception? |
|--------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|
| claim | reflection | Only exception: if describing the composability test generically ("a claim-like proposition") |
| reduce | surface | No exception — "reduce" is always research vocabulary |
| extract | surface | No exception — "extract insights" should be "surface insights" |
| MOC | theme | No exception — navigation units are "themes" not "MOCs" |
| topic map | theme | No exception |
| inbox | journal | No exception — the capture zone is a "journal" |
| pipeline | reflection cycle | No exception — "processing pipeline" should be "reflection cycle" |
| reweave | revisit | No exception — "reweave old notes" should be "revisit old reflections" |
| thinking notes | reflections | No exception |
| atomic note | reflection | Exception: if explaining the structural pattern generically in methodology documentation |
| processing pipeline | reflection cycle | No exception |
| claim note | reflection | No exception |
| /reduce | /surface | No exception — skill names must use domain vocabulary |
| /reflect | /find-patterns | No exception |
| /reweave | /revisit | No exception |
| /verify | /check-resonance | No exception |

**Additional structural terms to check:**

| Term | Should Appear As | Notes |
|------|-----------------|-------|
| 01_thinking/ | reflections/ | Folder references use domain vocabulary |
| 00_inbox/ | journal/ | Capture zone uses domain name |
| source material | session notes | Input vocabulary matches domain |
| extraction | surfacing | Processing verb matches domain |
| queue.json | Not present | No pipeline queue in moderate-processing therapy system |
| /ralph | Not present | No orchestration in convention-automation therapy system |
| subagent | Not present | No subagent infrastructure at this automation level |

**Expected result:** Zero leaked terms across all generated files.

**Acceptable exceptions (narrow):**
1. Meta-documentation explaining the system's origin ("this system was derived from CSP Workflow Engine methodology") may use the word "methodology" in its technical sense
2. The ops/derivation.md file records the derivation rationale and may reference the research-domain mapping as part of its provenance trail
3. Template `_schema` blocks use structural field names (`entity_type`, `applies_to`) that are system-internal, not user-facing

**Kernel validation prediction:** 15/15

**Coherence assessment:** Vocabulary transformation fidelity is not cosmetic — it determines whether the system feels native to its domain. A therapy user encountering "extract claims from sources" would experience cognitive dissonance: the system sounds like it was built for someone else and awkwardly repurposed. When every term is domain-native ("surface patterns in reflections"), the system feels purpose-built. This test validates that the transformation is complete and systematic, not partial. The search methodology is intentionally exhaustive because partial transformation is worse than no transformation — a system that says "surface reflections" in one paragraph and "extract claims" in the next signals inconsistency. The test also documents the narrow exceptions where research vocabulary is acceptable (meta-documentation, derivation provenance), preventing false positives from flagging legitimate uses.

## Test 8: Progressive Configuration Validation

**Question:** As a vault grows from 0 to 150 notes, does the full-automation-from-day-one approach work correctly — and can users selectively disable features they do not need?

**Input:**
- Use case: Personal learning system (concepts, study notes, reading insights)
- Platform: Claude Code
- Starting configuration: Full automation (all presets ship complete)

**Simulated growth trajectory:**

In v1.6, all vaults ship with full automation from day one. There are no tier boundaries to cross. Instead, this test validates that the complete system works at all scales, and that users can selectively disable features via /architect.

| Note Count | Activity | Expected Behavior |
|------------|----------|------------------|
| 0-5 | Initial capture, first concepts | Full system operational. All skills available. Templates enforce schema. Hooks automate orientation. Session capture saves transcripts. |
| 5-15 | Regular capture, first MOC created | Hub MOC appears naturally. Agent creates topic MOCs as clusters emerge. Condition-based maintenance has nothing to fire yet. |
| 15-50 | Steady growth, processing routine | Processing pipeline handles volume. Condition-based hooks begin evaluating state but most thresholds not yet reached. |
| 50-100 | Accelerating growth | Semantic search becomes increasingly valuable. Condition-based triggers begin firing (orphan detection, MOC size thresholds). /next surfaces maintenance tasks. |
| 100-150 | Full pipeline operation | Sub-MOCs emerge as topic MOCs exceed configured thresholds. Orchestration handles batch processing with fresh context per phase. |
| 150+ | Mature system | Evolution is within the configuration: better skill instructions, richer schemas, more sophisticated orchestration. Reseed may be triggered by accumulated drift. |

**Feature disabling validation:**

When a user disables a feature via /architect, the rest of the system must continue functioning:

| Disabled Feature | Expected Behavior | Degradation |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Semantic search (qmd) | Keyword search only. Skills fall back to grep. | Cross-vocabulary discovery reduced |
| Self space | Goals route to ops/goals.md, methodology to ops/methodology/. No self/ directory. | Identity persistence reduced but operational |
| Session capture | No stop hook saves transcripts. /remember still works manually. | Automatic friction detection lost |
| Processing pipeline | Manual processing only. Skills available but no orchestration. | Quality gates still in skills, no batch processing |

**Critical invariant: disabling features is safe and reversible.**

- Disabling semantic search does not break any skill (skills fall back to keyword search)
- Disabling self space routes its content to ops/ (no data loss)
- Re-enabling any feature restores full functionality
- The kernel primitives that are INVARIANT (wiki links, schema enforcement, methodology folder, session capture) cannot be disabled

**Kernel validation prediction:** 15/15 at all growth stages

**Coherence assessment:** v1.6 reverses the Gall's Law application: instead of growing from simple to complex, all vaults ship complete and users opt down. This works because the overhead of unused features is near-zero (hooks that never fire, skills that are never invoked, directories that stay empty). The cost of discovering and adding features was higher than the cost of having them present but dormant. The critical invariant shifts from "additive transitions" to "safe disabling" — removing a feature must never break the system. This is validated by the feature disabling table: each optional feature has a fallback path. INVARIANT primitives (wiki links, schema enforcement, methodology folder, session capture) cannot be disabled, ensuring the structural foundation is always present.

## Test 9: Operational Learning Loop Integration

**Question:** Does Primitive 12 (operational-learning-loop) function as a complete cycle — from capturing observations and tensions through threshold detection to triage and status lifecycle?

**Input:**
- Use case: Research vault (our vault's configuration)
- Platform: Claude Code
- Focus: Verify the full loop end-to-end, not just component existence

**Phase 1: Observation Capture**

Create 12 observations across categories to test capture mechanics:

| # | Observation Title | Category | Expected Location |
|---|-------------------|----------|------------------|
| 1 | "descriptions that restate titles waste progressive disclosure" | quality | ops/observations/ |
| 2 | "batch processing of 8+ claims degrades quality in later phases" | process | ops/observations/ |
| 3 | "semantic search misses notes created in the last 10 minutes" | friction | ops/observations/ |
| 4 | "MOC split at 40 notes felt premature — 50 would have been better" | methodology | ops/observations/ |
| 5 | "reflect phase consistently finds 3-5 connections per claim" | surprise | ops/observations/ |
| 6 | "enrichment tasks take longer than new claims because existing context must be loaded" | process | ops/observations/ |
| 7 | "validation hook catches missing descriptions but not weak descriptions" | friction | ops/observations/ |
| 8 | "reweave rarely changes titles but often adds 2-3 new connections" | methodology | ops/observations/ |
| 9 | "tenant sessions that skip orient phase produce lower quality output" | process | ops/observations/ |
| 10 | "cross-topic synthesis notes have 5x more incoming links than atomic claims" | surprise | ops/observations/ |
| 11 | "schema validation takes 3 seconds per note — acceptable at 200 notes" | quality | ops/observations/ |
| 12 | "dangling link detection finds 0-2 issues per batch — system is healthy" | quality | ops/observations/ |

**Capture validation:**
- Each observation has YAML frontmatter: `description`, `category`, `observed` (date), `status: pending`
- Each observation has prose-sentence title
- Each observation links to `[[observations]]` MOC
- MOC groups observations by category

**Phase 2: Tension Capture**

Create 6 tensions to test contradiction detection:

| # | Tension Title | Involves | Expected Location |

**Capture validation:**
- Each tension has YAML frontmatter: `description`, `observed`, `involves` (wiki links to notes in tension), `status: pending`
- Each tension has prose-sentence title
- Each tension links to `[[tensions]]` MOC
- MOC groups tensions by status (pending, resolved, dissolved)

**Phase 3: Threshold Detection**

With 12 pending observations (exceeds threshold of 10) and 6 pending tensions (exceeds threshold of 5):

| Check | Threshold | Actual | Triggered? |
|-------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Pending observations | >= 10 | 12 | YES |
| Pending tensions | >= 5 | 6 | YES |

**Expected behavior:** Session-start orientation surfaces the suggestion: "12 pending observations and 6 pending tensions exceed review thresholds. Consider running /rethink."

**Phase 4: Triage via /rethink**

Each pending observation receives one of four dispositions:

| Disposition | Meaning | Status After | Destination |
|-------------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Promote | Observation is a durable insight worthy of becoming a note | `promoted` | Create note in notes/, link back to observation |
| Implement | Observation suggests a system change | `implemented` | Update context file or skill, note the change |
| Archive | Observation is session-specific or no longer relevant | `archived` | Remains in ops/observations/ with archived status |
| Keep pending | Not enough evidence yet — needs more data | `pending` (unchanged) | Stays in ops/observations/ |

**Example triage outcomes:**

| Observation | Disposition | Rationale |
|-------------|------------|-----------|
| #1 (descriptions restate titles) | Promote | This is a reusable quality insight — becomes a note in notes/ |
| #2 (batch 8+ degrades) | Implement | This should update the context file's batch processing guidance |
| #3 (semantic search 10-min lag) | Archive | Infrastructure quirk, not a knowledge claim |
| #5 (3-5 connections per claim) | Keep pending | Interesting but needs more data to validate as a reliable metric |

**Tension triage outcomes:**

| Tension | Disposition | Rationale |
|---------|------------|-----------|
| #1 (atomic vs compound) | Resolved → create resolution note | The design dimensions framework already addresses this — link to existing note |
| #3 (semantic search at low volume) | Dissolved | Condition-based maintenance handles this — semantic search activates at friction, not at note count |
| #5 (discovery-first vs capture speed) | Keep pending | Genuine unresolved tension — needs more operational data |

**Phase 5: Status Lifecycle Verification**

Track that status transitions are valid:

| Valid Transition | Example |
|-----------------|---------|
| pending → promoted | Observation becomes a note |
| pending → implemented | Observation becomes a system change |
| pending → archived | Observation deemed irrelevant |
| pending → pending | Observation kept for more data |
| pending → resolved (tensions) | Tension resolved via resolution note |
| pending → dissolved (tensions) | Tension dissolved — not a real conflict |

| Invalid Transition | Why |
|-------------------|-----|
| promoted → pending | Cannot un-promote a note |
| implemented → pending | Cannot un-implement a change |
| archived → promoted | If it's worth promoting, it should not have been archived |
| resolved → pending | Resolution is final — if wrong, create a new tension |

**Full loop validation:**

```
Observe (create observation/tension)
  → Accumulate (notes collect in ops/)
    → Threshold (count exceeds limit)
      → Triage (/rethink evaluates each)
        → Promote (→ notes/) | Implement (→ context file) | Archive (→ stays with status) | Dissolve (→ tension resolved)
          → System improves (promoted insights enrich graph, implementations improve methodology)
            → Observe again (new friction from improved system)
```

**Kernel validation prediction:** 15/15

**Coherence assessment:** The operational learning loop is the system's immune system — it detects friction, accumulates evidence, and triggers targeted improvement. This test validates the entire cycle, not just the existence of obs/observations/ and ops/tensions/ directories. The critical findings are: (1) the threshold mechanism works as an attention filter — below threshold, observations accumulate silently; above threshold, the system demands review, (2) the four-disposition triage model (promote, implement, archive, keep) provides clear action paths for every observation, (3) the status lifecycle has valid transitions that prevent regression (you cannot un-promote or un-implement), and (4) the loop is genuinely recursive — improvements generate new friction, which generates new observations, which feeds back into the loop. Without this primitive, the system is static: it works as generated but never improves from experience. With it, the system converges toward its optimal configuration through accumulated operational evidence.

**Key findings:**

1. **Self-derivation validates the preset system.** The Research preset predicts our vault's configuration with zero dimension mismatches. Gaps are evolutionary features, not derivation failures.

2. **Cross-domain derivation requires vocabulary transformation.** The therapy test shows that changing vocabulary is not cosmetic — it changes how the system feels to use. "Surface patterns in reflections" is therapy work. "Extract claims from sources" is research work. Same structural operation, different cognitive framing.

3. **Novel domains derive successfully by reference mapping.** The gaming strategy test demonstrates that knowledge type classification → reference domain → adaptation works. The key insight is domain-specific schema fields (like `meta_state`) that emerge from the adaptation step, not from the reference domain.

4. **Multi-domain composition works through shared-graph-with-separate-templates.** Our vault already proves this pattern. The derivation engine needs to support it explicitly: generate separate templates per domain, shared navigation, and cross-domain linking conventions.

5. **The kernel requires only filesystem access and conventions.** The minimal platform test (Test 5) proves that all 15 primitives can be satisfied through context file instructions alone. Automation improves reliability but is not required for structural completeness. This means CSP Workflow Engine can generate valid systems for ANY platform that supports text files — the kernel's requirement floor is genuinely minimal.

6. **The constraint system is productive, not just prohibitive.** The violation recovery test (Test 6) shows that incoherent configurations are not dead ends — the constraint system guides users toward valid configurations by recommending minimal corrections. This is essential for conversational derivation where users express individually reasonable preferences that are collectively incoherent.

7. **Feature disabling is safe and reversible.** The progressive configuration test (Test 8) confirms that disabling optional features does not break the system. Each optional feature has a fallback path. INVARIANT primitives cannot be disabled, ensuring the structural foundation is always present. The system ships complete and users opt down — the reverse of the former tier-based approach.

**Derivation engine confidence: HIGH.** The 15 kernel primitives provide a universal base. The 8 configuration dimensions parameterize the variation space. Interaction constraints prevent incoherent combinations. The 3 presets (Research, Personal Assistant, Experimental) provide pre-validated starting points. The system derives working configurations for research, therapy, competitive gaming, multi-domain composition, minimal platforms, constraint recovery, vocabulary-verified domains, progressive configuration, and self-improving operational loops.
