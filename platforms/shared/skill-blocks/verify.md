## Runtime Configuration (Step 0 — before any processing)

Read these files to configure domain-specific behavior:

1. **`{config.ops_dir}/derivation-manifest.md`** — vocabulary mapping, platform hints
   - Use `vocabulary.notes` for the notes folder name
   - Use `vocabulary.note` / `vocabulary.note_plural` for note type references
   - Use `vocabulary.verify` for the process verb in output
   - Use `vocabulary.topic_map` for {DOMAIN:topic map} references
   - Use `vocabulary.templates` for the templates folder path
   - Use `vocabulary.cmd_reflect` for redirect when missing connections found

2. **`{config.ops_dir}/config.yaml`** — processing depth, verification settings
   - `processing.depth`: deep | standard | quick
   - `processing.verification.description_test`: true | false
   - `processing.verification.schema_check`: true | false
   - `processing.verification.link_check`: true | false

If these files don't exist, use universal defaults.

**Processing depth adaptation:**

| Depth | Verification Behavior |
|-------|-----------------------|
| deep | Full verification: cold-read prediction, complete schema check, exhaustive link verification, {DOMAIN:topic map} coverage, orphan risk analysis, content staleness detection, bundling analysis |
| standard | Balanced: cold-read prediction, schema check, link verification, {DOMAIN:topic map} coverage |
| quick | Basic: schema check, link verification only. Skip cold-read prediction and health analysis |

## EXECUTE NOW

**Target: $ARGUMENTS**

Parse immediately:
- If target contains a {vocabulary.note} name: verify that specific {vocabulary.note}
- If target contains `--handoff`: output RALPH HANDOFF block at end
- If target is "all" or "recent": verify recently created/modified {vocabulary.note_plural}
- If target is empty: ask which {vocabulary.note} to verify

## Anti-Shortcut Warning

Before marking verification as passed, you MUST complete ALL four categories:

1. COMPLETE description quality test — cold-read the title + description,
   predict what the {vocabulary.note} contains, compare against actual content.
   A description that merely restates the title FAILS.

2. COMPLETE schema validation — check ALL required fields from the
   template schema, verify ALL enum values are valid, confirm ALL
   constraints are met. A single missing required field FAILS.

3. COMPLETE link verification — confirm ALL wiki links in the {vocabulary.note}
   resolve to existing files. A single dangling link FAILS.

4. COMPLETE {DOMAIN:topic map} integration — verify the {vocabulary.note} appears in at least
   one {DOMAIN:topic map}'s Core Ideas section with a context phrase.
   A {vocabulary.note} with no {DOMAIN:topic map} mention FAILS.

Do NOT declare success after checking only one or two categories.
ALL FOUR must pass.

**Execute these steps IN ORDER:**

### Step 0: INDEX FRESHNESS CHECK

Before any retrieval tests, verify the semantic search index is current:

{if config.semantic_search}
1. Try `mcp__qmd__vector_search` with a simple test query to confirm MCP availability
2. If MCP is unavailable (tool fails or returns error), try qmd CLI (`qmd status`) to confirm local CLI availability
3. If either MCP or qmd CLI is available, proceed to Step 1
4. If neither MCP nor qmd CLI is available: note "retrieval test will be deferred" and proceed — do NOT let index issues block verification
{endif}

{if !config.semantic_search}
1. Semantic search is not configured — retrieval test will use grep-based findability check instead
2. Proceed to Step 1
{endif}

The index freshness check prevents false retrieval failures on recently created {vocabulary.note_plural}. If the index is stale, retrieval test results should be interpreted with that context.

### Step 1: RECITE (cold-read prediction test)

**CRITICAL: Do NOT read the full {vocabulary.note} yet. Only read frontmatter.**

This step tests whether the title + description alone enable an agent to predict the {vocabulary.note}'s content. The cold-read constraint is the entire point — reading the {vocabulary.note} first contaminates the prediction.

**1. Read ONLY title + description**

Use Read with a line limit to get just the first few lines of frontmatter. Extract:
- Title (the filename without .md)
- Description (the description field)

Do NOT scroll past the frontmatter closing `---`.

**2. Form prediction**

Before reading further, write out what you expect:
- Core argument: what claim does this {vocabulary.note} make?
- Mechanism: what reasoning or evidence does it use?
- Scope: what boundaries does the argument have?
- Likely connections: what other {vocabulary.note_plural} would it reference?

Write this prediction explicitly in your output. It must be specific enough to be wrong.

**3. Read full {vocabulary.note} content**

NOW read the complete {vocabulary.note}. Compare against your prediction.

**4. Score prediction accuracy (1-5)**

| Score | Meaning | Threshold |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| **5** | Perfect — description fully captured the argument | Pass |
| **4** | Strong — minor details missed, core predicted | Pass |
| **3** | Adequate — general area right, missed key aspects | Pass (minimum) |
| **2** | Weak — significant mismatch between prediction and content | FAIL |
| **1** | Failed — {vocabulary.note} argued something different than expected | FAIL |

**Passing threshold: 3 or above.**

**5. Run semantic retrieval test**

Test whether the description enables semantic retrieval:

{if config.semantic_search}
- (preferred): `mcp__qmd__vector_search` with query = "[the {vocabulary.note}'s description text]", collection = "{vocabulary.notes_collection}", limit = 10
- (CLI fallback): `qmd vsearch "[the {vocabulary.note}'s description text]" --collection {vocabulary.notes_collection} -n 10`
- if both MCP and qmd CLI are unavailable, report "retrieval test deferred (semantic search unavailable)" — do NOT skip silently

Check where the {vocabulary.note} appears in results:
- Top 3: description works well for semantic retrieval
- Position 4-10: adequate but could improve
- Not in top 10: flag — description may not convey the {vocabulary.note}'s meaning
{endif}

{if !config.semantic_search}
- Run grep-based findability test: search for key terms from the description across {config.notes_dir}/
- Check if the {vocabulary.note} would be discoverable via keyword search using its description terms
- Report "semantic retrieval test not available — grep findability check used instead"
{endif}

**Why vector_search specifically:** Agents find {vocabulary.note_plural} via semantic search during /{vocabulary.reflect} and /{vocabulary.reweave}. Testing with keyword search tests the wrong retrieval method. Full hybrid search with LLM reranking compensates for weak descriptions — too lenient. vector_search tests real semantic findability without hiding bad descriptions behind reranking.

**6. Draft improved description if needed**

If prediction score < 3:
- Diagnose the failure: too vague? missing mechanism? wrong emphasis? restates title?
- Draft an improved description that would score higher
- If you have Edit tool access: apply the improvement

**7. Combined scoring**

| Prediction Score | Retrieval Rank | Suggested Action |
|------------------|----------------|------------------|
| 4-5 | top 3 | Description works — no changes needed |
| 3-4 | top 5 | Adequate — minor improvements possible |
| 3+ | 6-10 | Investigate — passes prediction but weak retrieval |
| any | not in top 10 | Flag for review — description may not enable retrieval |
| < 3 | any | FAIL — description needs rewriting |

### Step 2: VALIDATE (schema check)

Read the template that applies to this {vocabulary.note} type. Determine the template by checking:
- {vocabulary.note} location (e.g., {config.notes_dir}/ uses the standard {vocabulary.note} template)
- Type field in frontmatter (if present, may indicate a specialized template)

If the vault has templates with `_schema` blocks, read the `_schema` from the relevant template for authoritative field requirements. If no `_schema` exists, use the checks below as defaults.

**Required fields (FAIL if missing):**

| Field | Requirement | Severity |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| `description` | Must exist and be non-empty | FAIL |
| Topics footer or `topics` field | Must reference at least one {DOMAIN:topic map} | FAIL |

**Description constraints (WARN if violated):**

| Constraint | Check | Severity |
|------------|-------|----------|
| Length | Should be ~50-200 characters | WARN |
| Format | Single sentence, no trailing period | WARN |
| Content | MUST add NEW information beyond title | WARN |
| Semantic value | Should capture mechanism, not just topic | WARN |

**How to check "adds new info":** Read the title, read the description. If the description says the same thing in different words, it fails this check. A good description adds: mechanism (how/why), scope (boundaries), implication (what follows), or context (where it applies).

**YAML validity (FAIL if broken):**

| Check | Rule | Severity |
|-------|------|----------|
| Frontmatter delimiters | Must start with `---` and close with `---` | FAIL |
| Valid YAML | Must parse without errors | FAIL |
| No unknown fields | Fields not in the template | WARN |

**Domain-specific field enums (WARN if invalid):**

If the {vocabulary.note} has fields with enumerated values (type, category, status, etc.), check them against the template's `_schema.enums` block. Each invalid enum value produces a WARN.

**Relevant notes format (WARN if incorrect):**

| Constraint | Check | Severity |
|------------|-------|----------|
| Format | Array with context: `["[[{vocabulary.note}]] -- relationship"]` | WARN |
| Relationship type | Should use standard types: extends, foundation, contradicts, enables, example | INFO |
| Links exist | Each referenced {vocabulary.note} must exist as a file | WARN |

**Topics format (FAIL if invalid):**

| Constraint | Check | Severity |
|------------|-------|----------|
| Format | Array of wiki links: `["[[{vocabulary.topic_map}]]"]` | FAIL |
| Links exist | Each {DOMAIN:topic map} must exist as a file | WARN |

**Composability (WARN if fails):**

| Check | Rule | Severity |
|-------|------|----------|
| Title test | Can you complete "This {vocabulary.note} argues that [title]"? | WARN |
| Specificity | Is the claim specific enough to disagree with? | WARN |

### Step 3: REVIEW (per-note health checks)

Run these 5 checks on the {vocabulary.note}:

**1. YAML frontmatter integrity**
- File starts with `---`, has closing `---`
- YAML parses without errors
- No duplicate keys

**2. Description quality (independent of recite)**
- Description is present and non-empty
- Description adds information beyond the title
- Description is not just the title rephrased

**3. {DOMAIN:topic map} connection**
- {vocabulary.note} appears in at least one {DOMAIN:topic map}'s Core Ideas section
- How to check: grep for `[[{vocabulary.note} title]]` in files that serve as {DOMAIN:topic map}s
- The {vocabulary.note}'s Topics footer references a valid {DOMAIN:topic map}
- A {vocabulary.note} with no {DOMAIN:topic map} mention is orphaned — FAIL

**4. Wiki link density**
- Count outgoing wiki links in the {vocabulary.note} body (not just frontmatter)
- Expected minimum: 2 outgoing links
- If < 2: flag as sparse — the {vocabulary.note} is not participating in the graph
- Sparse {vocabulary.note_plural} should be routed to /{vocabulary.reflect} for connection finding

**5. Link resolution**
- Scan ALL wiki links in the {vocabulary.note} — body, frontmatter `relevant_notes`, and Topics
- For each `[[link]]`, confirm a matching file exists in the vault
- **Exclude** wiki links inside backtick-wrapped code blocks (single backtick or triple backtick) — these are syntax examples, not real links
- A single dangling link = FAIL with the specific broken link identified

**Deep-only checks (when processing.depth = deep):**

**6. Orphan risk assessment**
- Count incoming links: grep for `[[{vocabulary.note} title]]` across all .md files
- If 0 incoming links: AT RISK — {vocabulary.note} exists but nothing references it
- If 1 incoming link: LOW RISK — single point of connection
- If 2+ incoming links: OK

**7. Content staleness detection**
- Read the {vocabulary.note}'s content and assess whether claims still seem current
- Check if referenced concepts/tools/approaches have changed
- Flag anything that reads as potentially outdated

**8. Bundling analysis**
- Does the {vocabulary.note} make multiple distinct claims that could be separate {vocabulary.note_plural}?
- Check: could you link to part of this {vocabulary.note} without dragging unrelated context?
- If yes: flag for potential splitting

### Step 4: APPLY FIXES

If you have Edit tool access, apply fixes for clear-cut issues:

**Auto-fix (safe to apply):**
- Improved description if recite score < 3
- Missing `---` frontmatter delimiters
- Trailing period on description
- Missing Topics footer (if obvious which {DOMAIN:topic map} applies)

**Do NOT auto-fix (requires judgment):**
- Bundled {vocabulary.note_plural} (splitting requires understanding the claims)
- Content staleness (needs human review of factual accuracy)
- Missing connections (use /{vocabulary.reflect} instead — connection finding is its own phase)
- Ambiguous {DOMAIN:topic map} assignment (when {vocabulary.note} could fit multiple)

### Step 5: Compile Results

Combine all checks into a unified report:

```
=== VERIFY: [{vocabulary.note} title] ===

RECITE:
  Prediction score: N/5
  Retrieval rank: #N (or "not in top 10" or "deferred")
  Description: [pass/improved/needs work]

VALIDATE:
  Required fields: [PASS/FAIL — detail]
  Description constraints: [PASS/WARN — detail]
  Topics format: [PASS/FAIL — detail]
  Optional fields: [PASS/WARN/N/A]
  Relevant notes: [PASS/WARN/N/A]
  Composability: [PASS/WARN]

REVIEW:
  Frontmatter: [PASS/FAIL]
  Description quality: [PASS/WARN]
  {DOMAIN:topic map} connection: [PASS/FAIL — which {DOMAIN:topic map}]
  Wiki links: N outgoing [PASS/WARN if < 2]
  Link resolution: [PASS/FAIL — broken links listed]

Overall: [PASS / WARN (N warnings) / FAIL (N failures)]

Actions Taken:
- [List of fixes applied, or "none"]

Recommended Actions:
- [List of suggested next steps, or "none"]
===
```

### Step 6: Update task file and capture observations

- If a task file is in context (pipeline execution): update the `## {vocabulary.verify_title}` section with results
- Reflect on the process: friction? surprises? methodology insights? process gaps?
- If any observations worth capturing: create atomic note in the observations directory per the observation capture pattern
- If `--handoff` in target: output RALPH HANDOFF block (see below)

**START NOW.** The reference material below explains philosophy and methodology — use to guide reasoning, not as output to repeat.

---

# {vocabulary.verify_title}

Combined verification: recite (description quality) + validate (schema compliance) + review (health checks). Three lightweight checks in one context window.

## philosophy

**verification is one concern, not three.**

recite tests whether the description enables retrieval. validate checks schema compliance. review checks graph health. all three operate on the same {vocabulary.note}, read the same frontmatter, and together answer one question: is this {vocabulary.note} ready?

running them separately meant three context windows, three subagent spawns, three rounds of reading the same file. the checks are lightweight enough (combined context ~15-25% of window) that they fit comfortably in one session while staying in the smart zone.

> "the unit of verification is the {vocabulary.note}, not the check type."

## execution order matters

**Recite MUST run first.** The cold-read prediction test requires forming an honest prediction from title + description BEFORE reading the full {vocabulary.note}. If validate or review ran first (both read the full {vocabulary.note}), the prediction would be contaminated. Recite's constraint: predict first, read second.

**Index freshness runs before everything.** The retrieval test in recite depends on semantic search having current data. Without a freshness check, recently created {vocabulary.note_plural} produce false retrieval failures that obscure actual description quality issues.

After recite reads the full {vocabulary.note}, validate and review can run in any order since they both need the full content.

## recite: description quality

the testing effect applied to vault quality. read only title + description, predict what the {vocabulary.note} argues, then check. if your prediction fails, the description fails.

**why this matters:** descriptions are the API of the vault. agents decide whether to load a {vocabulary.note} based on title + description. a misleading description causes two failure modes:
- **false positive:** agent reads the {vocabulary.note} expecting X, wastes context on Y
- **false negative:** agent skips the {vocabulary.note} because description doesn't signal relevance

both degrade the vault's value as a knowledge tool.

{if config.semantic_search}
**retrieval test rationale:** agents find {vocabulary.note_plural} via semantic search during /{vocabulary.reflect} and /{vocabulary.reweave}. testing with BM25 keyword matching tests the wrong retrieval method. full hybrid search with LLM reranking compensates for weak descriptions — too lenient. vector_search tests real semantic findability without hiding bad descriptions.
{endif}

## validate: schema compliance

checks against the relevant template schema:

| Check | Requirement | Severity |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| `description` | Must exist, non-empty | FAIL |
| `topics` | Must exist, array of wiki links | FAIL |
| description length | < 200 chars | WARN |
| description content | Adds info beyond title | WARN |
| description format | No trailing period | WARN |
| domain enum fields | Valid values per template `_schema.enums` | WARN |
| `relevant_notes` format | Array with context phrases | WARN |
| YAML integrity | Well-formed, `---` delimiters | FAIL |
| Composability | Title passes "This {vocabulary.note} argues that [title]" test | WARN |

**FAIL means fix needed. WARN is informational but worth addressing.**

**template discovery:** The skill reads the template for the {vocabulary.note} type to get its `_schema` block. If no template exists or no `_schema` block is found, fall back to the default checks above.

## review: per-note health

5 focused checks per {vocabulary.note} (not a full vault-wide audit):

1. **YAML frontmatter** — well-formed, has `---` delimiters, valid parsing
2. **Description quality** — present, adds info beyond title, not a restatement
3. **{DOMAIN:topic map} connection** — appears in at least one {DOMAIN:topic map}
4. **Wiki link count** — >= 2 outgoing links (graph participation threshold)
5. **Link resolution** — all wiki links point to existing files (full body scan, excluding backtick-wrapped examples)

plus 3 deep-only checks for comprehensive audits:
6. **Orphan risk** — incoming link count (is anything pointing here?)
7. **Content staleness** — does the content still seem accurate?
8. **Bundling** — does the {vocabulary.note} make multiple distinct claims?

## common failure patterns

| Pattern | Symptom | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Title restated as description | Recite score 1-2, prediction trivially correct but content is richer | Rewrite description to add mechanism/scope |
| Missing {DOMAIN:topic map} | Review fails {DOMAIN:topic map} check | Add to appropriate {DOMAIN:topic map} or create Topics footer |
| Dangling links | Review fails link resolution | Remove link, create the target {vocabulary.note}, or fix the spelling |
| Sparse {vocabulary.note} | < 2 outgoing links | Route to /{vocabulary.reflect} for connection finding |
| Schema drift | Enum values not in template | Update {vocabulary.note} to use valid values, or propose enum addition |

## batch mode (--all)

When verifying all {vocabulary.note_plural}:

1. Discover all {vocabulary.note_plural} in {config.notes_dir}/ directory
2. For each {vocabulary.note}, run the full verification pipeline
3. Produce summary report:
   - Total {vocabulary.note_plural} checked
   - PASS / WARN / FAIL counts per category
   - Top issues grouped by check type
   - {vocabulary.note_plural} needing immediate attention (FAIL items)
   - Pattern analysis across failures

**Performance note:** In batch mode, the recite cold-read test runs honestly for each {vocabulary.note}. Do not "warm up" by reading multiple {vocabulary.note_plural} first — each prediction must be genuinely cold.

## standalone invocation

### /{vocabulary.verify} [{vocabulary.note}]

Run all three checks on a specific {vocabulary.note}. Full detailed report.

### /{vocabulary.verify} --all

Comprehensive audit of all {vocabulary.note_plural} in {config.notes_dir}/. Summary table + flagged failures.

### /{vocabulary.verify} --handoff [{vocabulary.note}]

Pipeline mode for orchestrator. Runs full workflow, outputs RALPH HANDOFF block.

## handoff mode (--handoff flag)

When invoked with `--handoff`, output this structured format at the END of the session:

```
=== RALPH HANDOFF: {vocabulary.verify} ===
Target: [[{vocabulary.note} name]]

Work Done:
- Recite: prediction N/5, retrieval #N, [pass/fail]
- Validate: [PASS/WARN/FAIL] (N checks, M warnings, K failures)
- Review: [PASS/WARN/FAIL] (N checks, M issues)
- Description improved: [yes/no]

Files Modified:
- {config.notes_dir}/[{vocabulary.note}].md (description improved, if applicable)
- [task file path] ({vocabulary.verify_title} section updated, if applicable)

Learnings:
- [Friction]: [description] | NONE
- [Surprise]: [description] | NONE
- [Methodology]: [description] | NONE
- [Process gap]: [description] | NONE

Queue Updates:
- Mark: {vocabulary.verify} done for this task
=== END HANDOFF ===
```

## task file update

When a task file is in context (pipeline execution), update the `## {vocabulary.verify_title}` section:

```markdown
## {vocabulary.verify_title}
**Verified:** [UTC timestamp]

Recite:
- Prediction: N/5 — [brief reason]
- Retrieval: #N via MCP vector_search or CLI vsearch (or "deferred")
- Description: [kept/improved — brief note]

Validate:
- Required fields: PASS
- Description constraints: PASS (147 chars, adds mechanism)
- Topics: PASS (["[[{vocabulary.topic_map}]]"])
- Optional: [status]

Review:
- Frontmatter: PASS
- {DOMAIN:topic map} connection: PASS ([[{vocabulary.topic_map}]])
- Wiki links: N outgoing
- Link resolution: PASS (all resolve)

Overall: [PASS/WARN/FAIL]
```

## Pipeline Chaining

/{vocabulary.verify} is the **final pipeline phase**. After verification completes:

- **manual:** Output "Verified. Pipeline complete." — no next step
- **suggested:** Output completion summary AND suggest marking task done in queue
- **automatic:** Task marked done, summary logged to task file

If verification FAILS (recite score < 3 or any FAIL-level issue), do NOT mark done. Instead:
- Output what failed and what needs fixing
- Keep task at `current_phase: "{vocabulary.verify}"` for re-run after fixes

The chaining output uses domain-native vocabulary from the derivation manifest.

## queue.json update (interactive execution)

When running interactively (NOT via orchestrator), YOU must execute queue updates:

```bash
TIMESTAMP=$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")
jq '(.tasks[] | select(.id=="TASK_ID")).status = "done" | (.tasks[] | select(.id=="TASK_ID")).completed = "'"$TIMESTAMP"'"' {config.ops_dir}/queue/queue.json > tmp.json && mv tmp.json {config.ops_dir}/queue/queue.json
```

The queue path uses the domain-native operations folder. Check `{config.ops_dir}/` or equivalent.

## critical constraints

**never:**
- read the {vocabulary.note} before forming the recite prediction (cold-read is the whole point)
- auto-fix FAIL-level issues without flagging them in the report
- skip the semantic retrieval test without reporting "deferred"
- leave failures without suggested improvements
- declare PASS after checking only some categories

**always:**
- run recite FIRST (before validate/review — execution order is load-bearing)
- be honest about prediction accuracy (inflated scores defeat the purpose)
- suggest specific improved descriptions for score < 3
- report all severity levels clearly (PASS/WARN/FAIL)
- update task file if one is in context
- capture observations for friction, surprises, or methodology insights
