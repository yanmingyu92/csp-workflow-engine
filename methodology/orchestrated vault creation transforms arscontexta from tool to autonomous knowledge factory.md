# orchestrated vault creation transforms csp-workflow-engine from tool to autonomous knowledge factory

ArsContexta v1 is a derivation engine: give it a persona and a domain, it derives a complete knowledge system with the right configuration, vocabulary, templates, and skills. But the derived system is empty. The notes directory has an index.md and nothing else. The human or their agent still needs to do the actual knowledge work — capturing sources, extracting claims, finding connections. Derivation solves the architectural problem but not the content problem.

Orchestration solves the content problem. By wrapping the derivation engine in an orchestration layer that researches topics, feeds results through the derived system's pipeline, and evaluates coverage against the stated goal, ArsContexta becomes something categorically different: not a tool that helps you set up a vault, but a system that builds domain knowledge for you. The user defines what they want to know. The system does the knowing.

This product evolution has three stages.

**Stage 1: Scaffolding** (ArsContexta v1). Derive the right structure for the user's domain. The init wizard resolves eight configuration dimensions, generates a context file, creates templates and skills, validates the kernel. The output is an empty but well-configured knowledge system. Value: saves hours of architectural decisions.

**Stage 2: Populated scaffolding** (orchestration MVP). Derive the structure AND fill it with researched content. The orchestrator runs 5-10 research cycles using Exa deep research, processes each through the target vault's pipeline, and evaluates quality. The output is a knowledge graph with 30-80 notes, meaningful connections, and curated MOCs. Value: saves weeks of research and processing.

**Stage 3: Continuous learning** (future). The orchestrated vault doesn't stop after initial population. It continues researching, tracking new publications, updating its knowledge graph as the domain evolves. The output is a living knowledge system that stays current. Value: replaces a research assistant.

The strategic insight is that since [[the derivation engine improves recursively as deployed systems generate observations]], orchestration at scale becomes a feedback accelerator. Each orchestrated vault generates operational observations about what works: which research seeds produce dense knowledge graphs, which configuration choices create friction in specific domains, which pipeline phases produce the most value. Ten orchestrated vaults generate ten times the operational observations that ten manual deployments would, because the orchestrator can systematically capture what worked and what didn't. This feedback loop improves derivation quality faster than organic adoption.

The technical architecture is intentionally simple. Since [[agent session boundaries create natural automation checkpoints that human-operated systems lack]], each `claude -p` call to the target vault is a natural checkpoint. The orchestrator can inspect the filesystem after each call, evaluate progress, and adjust strategy. No complex inter-process communication, no shared state beyond the filesystem. The target vault doesn't even know it's being orchestrated — it just processes whatever appears in its inbox, same as it would if a human were working it.

The competitive positioning is significant. Most AI knowledge tools offer one of two things: retrieval (search your existing notes better) or capture (transcribe/summarize inputs). ArsContexta with orchestration offers generation: define a domain, get a populated knowledge graph. This is closer to what Exa's deep researcher does for individual queries, but extended to building persistent, navigable, interconnected knowledge structures rather than flat research reports.

Relevant Notes:
- [[derivation generates knowledge systems from composable research claims not template customization]] — derivation is the structural layer; orchestration adds the content layer, completing the vision of principled knowledge system generation
- [[the derivation engine improves recursively as deployed systems generate observations]] — orchestrated creation at scale becomes a feedback accelerator: 50 orchestrated vaults generate 50x the operational observations that manual deployments would
- [[goal-driven memory orchestration enables autonomous domain learning through directed compute allocation]] — the mechanism note; this note addresses the product and strategic implications
- [[agent session boundaries create natural automation checkpoints that human-operated systems lack]] — session boundaries in the target vault become automation checkpoints the orchestrator can monitor and act on
