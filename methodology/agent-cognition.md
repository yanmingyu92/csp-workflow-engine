# agent-cognition

How cognitive science informs the design of AI-agent-operated knowledge systems. Context window management, attention degradation, the generation effect.

## Core Ideas

### Research
- [[AI shifts knowledge systems from externalizing memory to externalizing attention]] -- Traditional PKM externalizes what you know (storage and retrieval), but agent-operated systems externalize what you atte
- [[LLM attention degrades as context fills]] -- The first ~40% of context window is the "smart zone" where reasoning is sharp; beyond that, attention diffuses and quali
- [[MOCs are attention management devices not just organizational tools]] -- MOCs preserve the arrangement of ideas that would otherwise need mental reconstruction, reducing the 23-minute context s
- [[agent notes externalize navigation intuition that search cannot discover and traversal cannot reconstruct]] -- Navigation intuition — traversal order, productive note combinations, dead ends — is structural knowledge that humans re
- [[agent self-memory should be architecturally separate from user knowledge systems]] -- An agent operating a knowledge vault accumulates preferences, working patterns, and self-understanding that need persist
- [[agent session boundaries create natural automation checkpoints that human-operated systems lack]] -- Discrete session architecture turns "no persistent memory" into a maintenance advantage because health checks fire at ev
- [[agents are simultaneously methodology executors and subjects creating a unique trust asymmetry]] -- The agent writes notes, finds connections, and builds synthesis while hooks validate its work, commit its changes, and c
- [[aspect-oriented programming solved the same cross-cutting concern problem that hooks solve]] -- AOP declared join points and advice to eliminate scattered logging and validation code in the 1990s, and agent hooks rep
- [[attention residue may have a minimum granularity that cannot be subdivided]] -- Micro-interruptions as brief as 2.8 seconds double error rates, suggesting an irreducible attention quantum below which 
- [[auto-commit hooks eliminate prospective memory failures by converting remember-to-act into guaranteed execution]] -- Prospective memory fails 30-50% of the time in humans and degrades with context load in agents, but event-triggered hook
- [[automated detection is always safe because it only reads state while automated remediation risks content corruption]] -- The read/write asymmetry in automation safety means detection at any confidence level produces at worst a false alert, w
- [[automation should be retired when its false positive rate exceeds its true positive rate or it catches zero issues]] -- Without retirement criteria the automation layer grows monotonically — checks added when problems appear but never remov
- [[closure rituals create clean breaks that prevent attention residue bleed]] -- Explicitly marking tasks as complete signals the brain to release them from working memory — for agents this means writi
- [[cognitive offloading is the architectural foundation for vault design]] -- Clark and Chalmers Extended Mind Theory plus Cowan's 4-item working memory limit explain why every capture friction poin
- [[cognitive outsourcing risk in agent-operated systems]] -- When agents handle all processing, humans may lose meta-cognitive skills for knowledge work even while vault quality imp
- [[coherence maintains consistency despite inconsistent inputs]] -- memory systems must actively maintain coherent beliefs despite accumulating contradictory inputs — through detection, re
- [[coherent architecture emerges from wiki links spreading activation and small-world topology]] -- The foundational triangle — wiki links create structure, spreading activation models traversal, small-world topology pro
- [[composable knowledge architecture builds systems from independent toggleable modules not monolithic templates]] -- Four traditions converge — component engineering (contracts), Unix (small tools), Alexander's pattern language (generate
- [[confidence thresholds gate automated action between the mechanical and judgment zones]] -- A three-tier response pattern (auto-apply, suggest, log-only) based on confidence scoring fills the gap between determin
- [[context files function as agent operating systems through self-referential self-extension]] -- The read-write context file that teaches agents how to modify itself crosses the line from configuration to operating sy
- [[data exit velocity measures how quickly content escapes vendor lock-in]] -- Three-tier framework (high/medium/low velocity) turns abstract portability into an auditable metric where every feature 
- [[dual-coding with visual elements could enhance agent traversal]] -- Cognitive science shows text+visuals create independent memory traces that reinforce each other — multimodal LLMs could 
- [[external memory shapes cognition more than base model]] -- retrieval architecture shapes what enters the context window and therefore what the agent thinks — memory structure has 
- [[federated wiki pattern enables multi-agent divergence as feature not bug]] -- Cunningham's federation applied to agent knowledge work -- linked parallel notes preserve interpretive diversity, with b
- [[flat files break at retrieval scale]] -- unstructured storage works until you need to find things — then search becomes the bottleneck, and for agents, retrieval
- [[four abstraction layers separate platform-agnostic from platform-dependent knowledge system features]] -- Foundation (files/conventions), convention (instruction-encoded standards), automation (hooks/skills/MCP), and orchestra
- [[fresh context per task preserves quality better than chaining phases]] -- Context rot means later phases run on degraded attention, so each task gets its own session to stay in the smart zone —

- [[goal-driven memory orchestration enables autonomous domain learning through directed compute allocation]] -- Define a persona and goal, allocate compute budget, get back a populated knowledge graph — the pattern shifts knowledge 
- [[hook composition creates emergent methodology from independent single-concern components]] -- Nine hooks across five events compose into quality pipelines, session bookends, and coordination awareness that no singl
- [[hook enforcement guarantees quality while instruction enforcement merely suggests it]] -- Hooks fire automatically regardless of attention state so quality checks happen on every operation, while instructions d

- [[schema validation hooks externalize inhibitory control that degrades under cognitive load]] -- Inhibitory control is the first executive function to degrade under load, so externalizing it to hooks means schema comp
- [[self-extension requires context files to contain platform operations knowledge not just methodology]] -- An agent that knows the methodology but not how to build hooks, skills, or agents on its specific platform cannot extend

- [[session outputs are packets for future selves]] -- each session's output should be a composable building block for future sessions — the intermediate packets pattern appli
- [[session transcript mining enables experiential validation that structural tests cannot provide]] -- Traditional tests check if output is correct but session mining checks if the experience achieved its purpose — friction
- [[skill context budgets constrain knowledge system complexity on agent platforms]] -- Claude Code allocates 2% of context for skill descriptions (16k char fallback), capping active modules at 15-20 and forc
- [[spreading activation models how agents should traverse]] -- Memory retrieval in brains works through spreading activation where neighbors prime each other. Wiki link traversal repl

## Open Questions

- How does context decay affect processing quality across pipeline phases?
- What cognitive biases apply to agent-operated systems?
