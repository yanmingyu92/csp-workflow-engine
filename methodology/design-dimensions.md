# design-dimensions

The 8 dimensions that define a knowledge system's configuration space. Granularity, organization, linking, processing, navigation, maintenance, schema, automation. How they interact and constrain each other.

## Core Ideas

### Research
- [[blueprints that teach construction outperform downloads that provide pre-built code for platform-dependent modules]] -- Platform-dependent modules ship as construction instructions so agents build contextually adapted artifacts — but bluepr
- [[composable knowledge architecture builds systems from independent toggleable modules not monolithic templates]] -- Four traditions converge — component engineering (contracts), Unix (small tools), Alexander's pattern language (generate
- [[configuration dimensions interact so choices in one create pressure on others]] -- Atomic granularity forces explicit linking, deep navigation, and heavy processing — the valid space is far smaller than 
- [[configuration paralysis emerges when derivation surfaces too many decisions]] -- Presenting every dimension as a question produces analysis paralysis — sensible defaults and inference should reduce the
- [[controlled disorder engineers serendipity through semantic rather than topical linking]] -- Luhmann's information theory insight — perfectly ordered systems yield zero surprise, so linking by meaning rather than 
- [[decontextualization risk means atomicity may strip meaning that cannot be recovered]] -- Extracting claims from source discourse strips argumentative context, and Source footers plus wiki links may not reconst
- [[dense interlinked research claims enable derivation while sparse references only enable templating]] -- Four structural properties of TFT research — atomic composability, dense interlinking, methodology provenance, and seman
- [[dependency resolution through topological sort makes module composition transparent and verifiable]] -- Topological sort on a module DAG resolves dependencies automatically while producing human-readable explanations that te
- [[derivation generates knowledge systems from composable research claims not template customization]] -- Templates constrain to deviation from fixed starting points while derivation traverses a claim graph to compose justifie
- [[derived systems follow a seed-evolve-reseed lifecycle]] -- Minimum viable seeding, friction-driven evolution, principled restructuring when incoherence accumulates — reseeding re-
- [[each module must be describable in one sentence under 200 characters or it does too many things]] -- The single-sentence test operationalizes Unix "do one thing" as a measurable constraint — if the description exceeds 200
- [[eight configuration dimensions parameterize the space of possible knowledge systems]] -- Granularity, organization, linking, processing intensity, navigation depth, maintenance cadence, schema density, and aut
- [[every knowledge domain shares a four-phase processing skeleton that diverges only in the process step]] -- Capture, connect, and verify are domain-invariant operations while the process step (extract claims, detect patterns, bu

- [[false universalism applies same processing logic regardless of domain]] -- The derivation anti-pattern where the universal four-phase skeleton is exported without adapting the process step — "ext
- [[friction-driven module adoption prevents configuration debt by adding complexity only at pain points]] -- Concrete thresholds — add after 5 manual repetitions, split above 500-char descriptions, remove after 3 unused sessions,
- [[goal-driven memory orchestration enables autonomous domain learning through directed compute allocation]] -- Define a persona and goal, allocate compute budget, get back a populated knowledge graph — the pattern shifts knowledge 
- [[implicit dependencies create distributed monoliths that fail silently across configurations]] -- When modules share undeclared coupling through conventions, environment, or co-activation assumptions, the system looks 
- [[justification chains enable forward backward and evolution reasoning about configuration decisions]] -- Traces each configuration decision to research claims, enabling forward (constraints to decisions), backward (decisions 
- [[knowledge systems share universal operations and structural components across all methodology traditions]] -- Eight operations and nine structural components recur across Zettelkasten, PARA, Cornell, Evergreen, and GTD — implement
- [[maintenance operations are more universal than creative pipelines because structural health is domain-invariant]] -- Structural health checks (validation, orphans, links, MOC coherence) transfer across domains and platforms while creativ
- [[methodology traditions are named points in a shared configuration space not competing paradigms]] -- Zettelkasten, PARA, Cornell, Evergreen, and GTD each make different choices along the same dimensions (granularity, link
- [[module communication through shared YAML fields creates loose coupling without direct dependencies]] -- YAML frontmatter functions as an event bus where one module writes a field and another reads it, so modules never call e
- [[module deactivation must account for structural artifacts that survive the toggle]] -- Enabling a module creates YAML fields, MOC links, and validation rules that persist after deactivation — ghost infrastru
- [[multi-domain systems compose through separate templates and shared graph]] -- Domain isolation at template and processing layers, graph unity at wiki link layer — five composition rules and four cro
- [[novel domains derive by mapping knowledge type to closest reference domain then adapting]] -- Six knowledge type categories identify which reference domain's processing patterns transfer to unfamiliar domains, then

- [[premature complexity is the most common derivation failure mode]] -- Derivation can produce systems with 12 hooks and 8 processing phases because the claim graph justifies them, but users a
- [[progressive schema validates only what active modules require not the full system schema]] -- Each module declares its required YAML fields and validation checks only active modules — otherwise disabling modules do
- [[scaffolding enables divergence that fine-tuning cannot]] -- agents with identical weights reach different conclusions when their external memory differs — scaffolding is the differ
- [[schema evolution follows observe-then-formalize not design-then-enforce]] -- Five signals (manual additions, placeholder stuffing, dead enums, patterned text, oversized MOCs) drive a quarterly prot
- [[schema field names are the only domain specific element in the universal note pattern]] -- The five-component note architecture (prose-title, YAML frontmatter, body, wiki links, topics footer) is domain-invarian
- [[schema fields should use domain-native vocabulary not abstract terminology]] -- When schema field names match how practitioners naturally think — "triggers" not "antecedent_conditions" — adoption succ
- [[storage versus thinking distinction determines which tool patterns apply]] -- PARA and Johnny.Decimal optimize for filing and retrieval ("where did I put that?") while Zettelkasten and ACCESS/ACE op

- [[use-case presets dissolve the tension between composability and simplicity]] -- Curated module selections for common use cases (Research Vault, PKM, Project Management) give template-level simplicity 

## Tensions

(Capture conflicts as they emerge)

## Open Questions

- Which dimension cascades have the strongest pressure effects?
- Can dimension positions be inferred from observable vault behavior?
